## Observations for pymaceuticals

1.) There is a positive correlations between weight and the average tumor. The average tumor is 0.84 indicates there is a relationship because it is closer to 1. 
2.) Capomulin treatment is effective. In the analysis, mouse id (I509) decreased volume of tumor over x amount of days. 
3.) shown in the boxplot, capumulin and ramicane are effective treatments compared to Infubitol and Ceftamin. Infubitol had an outlier (red circle) which could have been due several reasons (e.g inaccurate data captured, etc)
